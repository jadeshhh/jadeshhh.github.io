  <p id="first">My name is Jade Iwadare Shen. I am half Japanese, and half Chinese. I am 15 years old, and am going to be a junior at Bronx Science. I love ice skating! My favorite ice skaters are pictured above.
<br>I want to go to Japan in 2020 for the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/tokyo-2020">Olympics</a>, and I also want to travel to Korea and Taiwan while I am at it. I love traveling!
